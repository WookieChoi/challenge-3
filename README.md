# Challenge-3

## Description

This challenge adds functionality to the JavaScript starter file. Within the JS file, I initialized a bunch of global arrays. Created a user prompt function that checks for valid inputs and concatenates the arrays. Made a password generation function that uses the Math object and random function in addition with the arrays to create a new password.

## Installation

Follow the URLs in the dropbox.

## Usage

To use the website, type the URL to the browser's search. Press the "generate password" button to begin the password generation process. It'll prompt for the password length. It'll ask to confirm whether or not to add special characters, lowercase letteres, and uppercase letters. It'll then generate a random number based on your answers.
